# MeshCore Web

A simple, mobile friendly, web based [MeshCore](https://github.com/ripplebiz/MeshCore) client for the [Companion Radio Firmware](https://github.com/ripplebiz/MeshCore/blob/main/examples/companion_radio/main.cpp).

**No longer updated**

Please note, this web client is no longer being updated, however it will remain open source as a reference for anyone looking to build their own MeshCore client.

This web client has been replaced by the new cross-platform Flutter app, which has a consistent experience across Android, iOS and Web.
